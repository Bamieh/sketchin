# SKETCHIN'

Oh hai, thanks for checkin' in. This repo has all them cool sketchnotes (or the ones that turned out nice) that I've been putting together. They are organized either under [conferences](https://github.com/lrlna/sketchin/tree/master/coferences) (currently empty, but give me some time to scan :sparkles:) or [guides](https://github.com/lrlna/sketchin/tree/master/guides) and will be linked up to their initial sources.

Hope you enjoy! (((ೕ( ･ㅂ･ )و )))
