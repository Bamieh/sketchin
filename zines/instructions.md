## Zine Printing Instructions.

You will need:
- [x] printer
- [x] a pair of scisors

When printing, print on Letter Size paper (that's 8" x 11", or 210mm x 297mm).
Use the setting that let's you print all the way to the edge since otherwise
you might miss some things. Your end result should be a v smol book.

Start off with your letter sized printout:
![step1](/zines/img/insructions/step1)

Fold it over on the longer edge with the printed out portion being on the
outside:
![step1](/zines/img/insructions/step2)

Unfold whatever you just folded, and then fold on the shorter edge. Again, keep
the printed portion on the outside:
![step1](/zines/img/insructions/step3)

With the clear side up, fold both of the sides from the fold above ^^ inward
again. Fold one:
![step1](/zines/img/insructions/step4)

And fold two. You should end up with a square like this:
![step1](/zines/img/insructions/step5)

You should be able to fold the paper in a little accordion like this:
![step1](/zines/img/insructions/step6)

With the clear side up, unfold the acordion you had above, and cut through the
middle, leaving the edge pages uncut. That is, only the middle pages should
have a cut through. You should be able to separate your pages like this:
![step1](/zines/img/insructions/step7)

Take your paper, and with a printed side out, fold it like a little starfish.
The pages you cut above should be on top, and the edge of your paper on the
bottom:
![step1](/zines/img/insructions/step8)

Fold it in so both sides have two pages each, and these two pages are on the
outside:
![step1](/zines/img/insructions/step9)

Fold it in again so you end up with a little book:
![step1](/zines/img/insructions/step10)
